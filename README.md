# Predicting Glass Transition Temperature using Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code and dataset for predicting the **Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)** of organic compounds using machine learning techniques. The study explores the limitations of traditional empirical models, such as the **Boyer-Beaman rule**, and introduces a data-driven approach utilizing molecular descriptors, including branching, to improve Tg prediction.

## Background

**Soft Matter Physics**  
Soft matter physics deals with materials that can easily deform under external forces, such as **polymers, colloids, gels, foams, and biological tissues**. The glass transition temperature (Tg) is a key property in understanding the thermal behavior of these materials.

**Glass Transition Temperature (Tg)**  
Tg is the temperature at which a material transitions from a rigid, glassy state to a more flexible, rubbery state. This transition is critical in determining the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers and other amorphous materials.

## Approach

- **Feature Selection:** The study considers molecular descriptors like **branching, molecular weight, and functional group ratios** to predict Tg.
- **Machine Learning Models:** The models tested include **Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Symbolic Regression**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Performance is measured using **RÂ² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

## Key Findings

- The traditional **Boyer-Beaman rule** estimates Tg based on **melting temperature (Tm)**, but Tm measurements can be inconsistent.
- **Branching** is a more robust predictor than Tm, as it is a structural property of molecules and is independent of experimental variations.
